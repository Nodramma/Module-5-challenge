# Module-5-challenge

In this assignment I created financial analysis tools:

A financial planner for visualisation of savings. 

And a financial planner for forecasting the performance of portfolio in different time frames. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
